# text-editor

## Description 
This is a single page PWA or progressive web application. This text-editor runs on the browser but also incorporates the use of service workers to be able 
to run in offline mode or in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. We implement methods in this application to get and store data 
to an IndexedDB database. This application also uses webpack builds to compress our javascript files and bundle them all to one location and can be 
installed on your system as a PWA.
